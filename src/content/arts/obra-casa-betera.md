This 3D rendering was created as a preliminary artwork for a construction company, providing a realistic preview of a future residential building located in BÃ©tera, Valencia. Using detailed architectural plans provided by the company, I crafted a lifelike representation of the final vision for the property. This render is intended to help clients visualize the finished structure and ensure it aligns with their expectations.

Creating a realistic 3D render based on the architectural plans required precise attention to detail, from textures to lighting. The goal was to represent the materials and aesthetic features as accurately as possible, ensuring that the render would serve as an effective preview for potential buyers.
