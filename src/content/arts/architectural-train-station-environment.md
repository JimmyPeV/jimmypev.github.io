This environment was part of a TFM project for a group of architecture students.
I was given basic 2D floor plans in AutoCAD.
From there, I handled the full 3D buildout in Blender—raising walls, shaping volumes, and giving form to their concept.
The goal was clear: turn flat technical drawings into a realistic architectural visualization.
I focused on lighting, materials, and camera composition to bring the space to life.
Every angle was designed to feel grounded in reality—like a station you could actually walk through.
